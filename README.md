Object-Oriented Programming in C#
This repository contains examples and explanations of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#. Each file focuses on a specific topic related to OOP, providing code snippets and explanations to help you understand and implement these concepts in your own projects.

File Descriptions
abstractclass.cs

This file contains examples of abstract classes in C#. It explains how to define abstract classes and methods, and how to inherit from abstract classes.
acess_specifiers.cs

This file explains access specifiers in C#. It covers the different levels of access control (public, private, protected, internal) and how they affect the visibility and accessibility of classes and members.
construct_life_cycle_same_method_in_pnc.cs

This file demonstrates the constructor lifecycle and the use of the same method in parent and child classes. It covers how constructors are called in inheritance hierarchies and the concept of constructor chaining.
delegates.cs

This file provides an introduction to delegates in C#. It explains what delegates are, how to declare and use them, and their significance in event handling and callback mechanisms.
encapsulation.cs

This file focuses on encapsulation, one of the fundamental principles of OOP. It explains how to achieve encapsulation using access specifiers and properties, and why encapsulation is important for maintaining code integrity and security.
multilvl_inheritence.cs

This file illustrates multi-level inheritance in C#. It shows how classes can inherit from other classes, forming a hierarchy of inheritance, and discusses the implications and uses of multi-level inheritance.
para_constructor.cs

This file covers parameterized constructors. It explains how to define constructors that take parameters, and how to use them to initialize objects with specific values upon creation.
polymorphism.cs

This file delves into polymorphism, another key concept of OOP. It explains both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism, with examples to illustrate how polymorphism allows for flexible and reusable code.
sealed_classes.cs

This file discusses sealed classes. It explains what sealed classes are, how to define them, and why you might want to prevent further inheritance from a class.
Usage
Each file can be used independently to understand and implement the specific OOP concept it covers. Simply open the file and review the code and comments provided. You can also modify the code and run it in your local C# development environment to see the concepts in action.
